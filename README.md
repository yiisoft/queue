## Installation

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```
php composer.phar require --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii-queue
```

or add

```
"yiisoft/yii-queue": "~3.0"
```

to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file.

## Ready for yiisoft/config

If you are using [yiisoft/config](https://github.com/yiisoft/config), you'll find out this package has some defaults
in the [`common`](config/common.php) and [`params`](config/params.php) configurations saving your time. Things you should
change to start working with the queue:
- Optionally: define default `\Yiisoft\Yii\Queue\Adapter\AdapterInterface` implementation.
- And/or define channel-specific `AdapterInterface` implementations in the `channel-definitions` params key to be used
  with the [queue factory](#different-queue-channels).
- Define [message handlers](docs/guide/worker.md#handler-format) in the `handlers` params key to be used with the `QueueWorker`.
- Resolve other `\Yiisoft\Yii\Queue\Queue` dependencies (psr-compliant event dispatcher).

## Differences to yii2-queue

If you have experience with `yiisoft/yii2-queue`, you will find out that this package is similar.
Though, there are some key differences which are described in the "[migrating from yii2-queue](docs/guide/migrating-from-yii2-queue.md)" article.

## Basic Usage

Each queue task consists of two parts:

1. A message is a class implementing `MessageInterface`. For simple cases you can use the default implementation,
   `Yiisoft\Yii\Queue\Message\Message`. For more complex cases you should implement the interface by your own.
2. A message handler is a callable called by a `Yiisoft\Yii\Queue\Worker\Worker`. The handler handles each queue message.

For example, if you need to download and save a file, your message may look like the following:

```php
$data = [
    'url' => $url,
    'destinationFile' => $filename,
];
$message = new \Yiisoft\Yii\Queue\Message\Message('file-download', $data);
```

Then you should push it to the queue:

```php
$queue->push($message);
```

Its handler may look like the following:

```php
class FileDownloader
{
    private string $absolutePath;

    public function __construct(string $absolutePath) 
    {
        $this->absolutePath = $absolutePath;
    }

    public function handle(\Yiisoft\Yii\Queue\Message\MessageInterface $downloadMessage): void
    {
        $fileName = $downloadMessage->getData()['destinationFile'];
        $path = "$this->absolutePath/$fileName"; 
        file_put_contents($path, file_get_contents($downloadMessage->getData()['url']));
    }
}
```

The last thing we should do is to create a configuration for the `Yiisoft\Yii\Queue\Worker\Worker`:

```php
$handlers = ['file-download' => [new FileDownloader('/path/to/save/files'), 'handle']];
$worker = new \Yiisoft\Yii\Queue\Worker\Worker(
    $handlers, // Here it is
    $dispatcher,
    $logger,
    $injector,
    $container
);
```

There is the way to run all the messages that are already in the queue, and then exit:

```php
$queue->run(); // this will execute all the existing messages
$queue->run(10); // while this will execute only 10 messages as a maximum before exit
```

If you don't want your script to exit immediately, you can use the `listen` method:

```php
$queue->listen();
```

You can also check the status of a pushed message (the queue adapter you are using must support this feature):

```php
$queue->push($message);
$id = $message->getId();

// Get status of the job
$status = $queue->status($id);

// Check whether the job is waiting for execution.
$status->isWaiting();

// Check whether a worker got the job from the queue and executes it.
$status->isReserved();

// Check whether a worker has executed the job.
$status->isDone();
```

## Different queue channels

Often we need to push to different queue channels with an only application. There is the `QueueFactory` class to make
different `Queue` objects creation for different channels. With this factory channel-specific `Queue` creation is as
simple as

```php
$queue = $factory->get('channel-name');
```

The main usage strategy is with explicit definition of channel-specific adapters. Definitions are passed in
the `$definitions` constructor parameter of the factory, where keys are channel names and values are definitions
for the [`Yiisoft\Factory\Factory`](https://github.com/yiisoft/factory). Below are some examples:

```php
use Yiisoft\Yii\Queue\Adapter\SynchronousAdapter;

[
    'channel1' => new SynchronousAdapter(),
    'channel2' => static fn(SynchronousAdapter $adapter) => $adapter->withChannel('channel2'),
    'channel3' => [
        'class' => SynchronousAdapter::class,
        '__constructor' => ['channel' => 'channel3'],
    ],
]
```

For more information about a definition formats available see the [factory](https://github.com/yiisoft/factory) documentation.

Another queue factory usage strategy is implicit adapter creation via `withChannel()` method call. To use this approach
you should pass some specific constructor parameters:

- `true` to the `$enableRuntimeChannelDefinition`
- a default `AdapterInterface` implementation to the `$defaultAdapter`.

In this case `$factory->get('channel-name')` call will be converted
to `$this->queue->withAdapter($this->defaultAdapter->withChannel($channel))`, when there is no explicit adapter definition
in the `$definitions`.

> Warning: This strategy is not recommended as it does not give you any protection against typos and mistakes
> in channel names.

## Adapter behaviors

Some of queue adapters support different behaviors like delayed execution and prioritized queues.

**Important:** Not every adapter supports all the behaviors. See concrete adapter documentation to find out if
it supports the behavior you want to use. Adapter will throw a `BehaviorNotSupportedException` if it does not support
some behaviors attached to the message you are trying to push to the queue.

### Delay behavior

To be sure message will be read from queue not earlier then 5 seconds since it will be pushed to the queue, you can use `DelayBehavior`:

```php
$message->attachBehavior(new DelayBehavior(5));
$queue->push($message);
```

## Console execution

The exact way of task execution depends on the adapter used. Most adapters can be run using
console commands, which the component automatically registers in your application.

The following command obtains and executes tasks in a loop until the queue is empty:

```sh
yii queue/run
```

The following command launches a daemon which infinitely queries the queue:

```sh
yii queue/listen
```

See the documentation for more details about adapter specific console commands and their options.

The component also has the ability to track the status of a job which was pushed into queue.

For more details see [the guide](docs/guide/README.md).
